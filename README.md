This code shows the frame number, the nucleotide and amino acid start and stop positions,the length of the ORFs in nucleotide/ amino positions 
and display the DNA/AA sequence for all potential realistic open reading frames using a fasta file. The sars cov 2 fasta file was used in this case(provided
in the repo). The nucleotide limit used was 300 and the output is based closely off the NCBI open reading frame finder output
